2 hours of tinkering with unity system and tried to implement working inventory system. 

# Goals

Get familliar with Unity system

# Foundation

By using Unity's built-in demo FPS project, I managed to implement "somewhat" functional inventory system. Currently the weapon state is not managable as demo has its own weaponry system
that I will try to reduce and add my own.
