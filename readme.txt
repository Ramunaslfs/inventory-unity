# Status

After 2 hours of tinkering with unity system, I managed to create a working inventory system. Items are displayed in game (currently as dummy text objects) and on collission
item is added in your inventory. Not so many dynamics or paramters yet (just dummy weight system). If the item is too heavy you can not add. Will have to tinker with ids to
set dynamically and will add a feature to drop an item, so the carrying capacity will reduce. 

# Goals

Get familliar with Unity system.
- Add speed affection - more weight you carry, less speed you get;
- Dropping items;
- Change existing weapon inventory system;
- Dynamics for ids so that you can change through numbers 1,2,3,4,5 (will have to make models for that)
- Add icons to GUI (learn GUI system better as currently it is a dummy GUI from what I understood after watching couple of videos)
- Possibility to change items placement;

# Foundation

By using Unity's built-in demo FPS project, I managed to implement "somewhat" functional inventory system. Currently the weapon state is not managable as demo has its own weaponry system
that I will try to reduce and add my own.
